Yeah
This lifestyle not for you, but it's for me, yeah
Dreamville's finest (real shit)
Bas (yeah)
DJ Drama (woo, woo, woo)

Never let a wishbone grow where a backbone should
Bentley Bentayga, the dash all wood
Niggas send payments, the backend good
Niggas got sense, but they act no good (why?)

Slide through the lot and them bitches is starstruck
Hop in the ride that we took in the Tri
Couple lines in the truck and they all fuck (woah)
They might say, "What's up?" when they see me 'round the city
But really, no reason to talk much
Dinner at Nice Guy, but no nice guys here
I'm toe-taggin', no Bilbo Baggins, y'all comin' up short
Take a recess, this a heat check, yeah (coo-coo)

Shawty let me hit it quick as the clear with the PreCheck (woah)
This lifestyle not for you, but it's for me (what?)
Seen it myself for years, the vision is mine
Alone, just me, myself, no peers (woah)
Yeah (woo, woo, woo, let's work)

I don't know who hypin' them boys
I'm done givin' life for the noise
I give you my life from the source
I don't even write anymore, yeah (gangsta, what?)
Get in and drove like it's whippin' the stove
That bitch break heart like habits
No days off, no Sabbath
No snakes in my yard, no rabbits (woo, woo)

Never let a wishbone grow where a backbone should (yeah)
Bentley Bentayga, the dash all wood (yeah)
Niggas send payment, the backend good (yeah)
Niggas got sense, but they act no good (why?)
Still the same money, this a band (yeah)
I could probably feed the goddamn hood for a year or two (yeah)
Stuck between stuntin' and a miracle (coo-coo), for real

Let's explore the moment
Niggas ain't outside, they agoraphobic
If you see me live, nigga, you would know it
Hoes jumping on my dick, it do aerobics
Bas like P90X (yeah, woah)
Boss-like, we write the checks now
Floss like we like to flex (woo)
Bust down, bust down, bust down (right, right, right, oh)

AMG, no bus now
Amiri jeans, SB Dunks with a Fiends tee, no button-down (woo)
Respectfully, niggas blasphemy, don't fuck around (ayy)
You fuck around if you wanna, you fuck around if you wanna
This lifestyle not for you, but it's for me (woo), Bassy

Bas, I'ma go without the ad-libs
(Hoo, hoo) huh, nah
Cigars in the booth and I puff it like poof
I don't understand what got into me
Got a couple of troops that'll bust out the roof
If I'm ready to ride on my enemy
And you rappers that stole my identity
And I really know why you ain't feelin' me

I bust on the buck with Tiffany
And these bitches restore my agility
And I'm never rehearsin'
Makin' a million a verse just like Swizzy and Timothy
Never provoke with the G.O.A.T. 'cause I want all the smoke
You could call me a chimney
And I really want ass, but I settle for throat
I just ain't a dick rider, the widow's peak
Aim at your head when I kill the beat
Spaghetti, your shells like Italy (woo, woo)

Never let a wishbone grow where a backbone should (yeah)
Bentley Bentayga, the dash all wood (yeah)
Niggas send payment, the backend good (yeah)
Niggas got sense, but they act no good (why?)
Still the same money, this a band (yeah)
I could probably feed the goddamn hood for a year or two (yeah)
Stuck between stuntin' and a miracle, for real

Alright, now close your eyes
Think about your wildest dreams
You ready?
And you still couldn't do this
