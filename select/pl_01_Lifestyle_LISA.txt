Fast cars, drop tops and tank tops
Diamonds on my tick-tock
That's just my lifestyle, oh-woah
L.A. to Bangkok
Can't stop, so we don't stop
That's just my lifestyle, oh-woah
Hold my phone, shut up and watch me go
Southside,oh, shut up and watch me blow
This, that, mm, she make millions
That's that, mmm, fuck your opinions
That's that, no, no, no
I did it on my own
Lo-lo-lo-lovin' it, these checks be comin' in
These checks be doublin', she a icon
Po-po-po-pour it up, we just don't give a fuck
This ain't just luck, this my lifestyle
Fast cars, drop tops and tank tops
Diamonds on my tick-tock
That's just my lifestyle, oh-woah
L.A. to Bangkok
Can't stop so we don't stop
That's just my lifestyle, oh-woah
We turnin' up in Abu Dhabi
Got that bass, bass jumping
I know they never see me comin'
That's just my lifestyle
that's just my lifestyle
Oh-woah
Hold my phone, shut up and watch me go
Every time I walk by, you turn to your friend
and you ask them, "Mm, did you see her?"
Had to put the shades on, she was like blindin',
she was like somethin' like a diamond
Somethin' just struck me, she was like
lightnin', I think she gave me a fever
We pullin' up, we pullin' up, shit go off when
you take one look at us
It goes up and there ain't no stoppin' us
If it ain't money, I ain't comin' at one
Now pose for the camera, oh, my gosh, she's a
star like boulevard
She flashy, fancy, classy, nasty
She do what she want, what she want and everyone
else
Lo-lo-lo-lovin' it, these checks be comin' in
These checks be doublin', she a icon
Po-po-po-pour it up, we just don't give a fuck
This ain't just luck, this my lifestyle
Fast cars, drop tops and tank tops
Diamonds on my tick-tock
That's just my lifestyle, oh-woah
L.A. to Bangkok
Can't stop so we don't stop
That's just my lifestyle, oh-woah
We turnin' up in Abu Dhabi
Got that bass, bass jumping
I know they never see me comin'
That's just my lifestyle, that's just my
lifestyle
Oh-woah
Fast cars, drop tops and tank tops
Diamonds on my tick-tock
That's just my lifestyle, oh-woah
L.A. to Bangkok
Can't stop so we don't stop
That's just my lifestyle
